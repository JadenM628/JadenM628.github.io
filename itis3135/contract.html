            <h2>Course Contract</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left"><strong>I, Jaden Marquez agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my FALL 2022, ITIS 3135, Web App Design and Devlopment with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left"><strong>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left"><strong>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left"><strong>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</strong></p>
