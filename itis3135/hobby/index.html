        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have been interested in sports for as long as i can remember. I started collecting cards a couple of years ago. 
           There are cards available in almost every sport there is.</p>

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <h4>Origin of Trading Cards</h4>
        <p>The original ‚Äútrade cards‚Äù were advertising cards that were packaged with cigarettes for the purpose of stiffening the packaging. In the 1860s, shortly after baseball‚Äôs inception as a professional sport, baseball cards were printed, usually being sold in packets of candy or tobacco products.</p>

        </figure>
        <br>
        <p>In the 1870s and early 1900s, the popularization of ‚Äúcolor lithography‚Äù or multi-color printing, led to the increased popularity of the ‚Äútrade card.‚Äù Companies of all kinds would insert these cards into product packaging as a prize. The designs on the cards were often not product-related, but were humorous or beautiful, depending on the perceived tastes of the consumer.</p>

            <figcaption>Graded Sports Cards!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>
        <p>Valued for their vibrant, full-color imagery, the public began to collect these cards, storing their collections in scrapbooks and albums. People would often trade with each other to obtain a complete set, hence the origin of their name. These cards faded in popularity as color printing became more common, but the concept of collecting trading cards was born.</p>
